FEATURES
- New ability system, each class has a unique special ability outside of their armor ability
- Elite players will now take control of campaign variants of elites with (mostly) accurate colors
- Dynamic kill boundaries which prevent spawn killing
- Assault final phase, which has players destroy the final objective instead of capturing it
- Changed default loadouts to pair better with new special abilities
- Ability to set multiple spawn points per frontline
- "Anti-tryhard" option, to limit proliferation of precision weapons

BUG FIXES
- The primary respawn should now consistently be the closest to the frontline
- Elites will no longer capture for Spartans if "Capture Time Scaling" is disabled
- Elites will actually have "Capture Time Scaling" disabled if the option is set to disabled (oops)
